# 🚀 **Case Study: Scalable Web App Deployment on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

## **📌 Overview**
This case study details the end-to-end process of deploying a scalable, secure, and highly available web application using **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. The project involved **containerization, CI/CD automation, autoscaling, monitoring, and security best practices**, ensuring an industry-standard deployment.

### **🎯 Goal**
To deploy a Flask (Python) or Node.js web application on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** with **CI/CD, autoscaling, monitoring, and security**.

### **🔹 Key Features Implemented**
✅ **Containerization (Docker)**  
✅ **Azure Container Registry (ACR) for Image Management**  
✅ **Kubernetes Deployments & Services**  
✅ **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for Auto-Scaling**  
✅ **Ingress Controller & Load Balancer for Traffic Management**  
✅ **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps)**  
✅ **Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)**  
✅ **Security (Azure Key Vault, RBAC)**  

---

## **🛠 Step-by-Step Implementation**

### **1️⃣ Containerization using Docker**
**What We Did:**
- Created a **Dockerfile** to package the Flask/Node.js app into a container.
- Built the image and tested it locally.

**Why?**
- Containers **standardize deployments** and ensure portability.
- They simplify **scaling and dependency management**.

---

### **2️⃣ Storing the Image in Azure Container Registry (ACR)**
**What We Did:**
- Created an **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
- Pushed the container image to ACR.

**Why?**
- ACR provides a **secure, private registry** for our images.
- Ensures **faster and safer deployments** in Azure.

---

### **3️⃣ Deploying the Application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
**What We Did:**
- Provisioned an **AKS cluster**.
- Deployed the application using **Kubernetes Deployments and Services**.

**Why?**
- AKS provides **managed Kubernetes**, reducing operational overhead.
- **Ensures scalability, high availability, and self-healing**.

---

### **4️⃣ Exposing the Application using Load Balancer & Ingress Controller**
**What We Did:**
- Configured a **LoadBalancer service**.
- Set up an **Ingress Controller** for URL routing and SSL termination.

**Why?**
- The LoadBalancer ensures **external access to the application**.
- The Ingress Controller **manages complex traffic routing efficiently**.

---

### **5️⃣ Enabling Auto-Scaling with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**
**What We Did:**
- Configured **HPA** to scale pods based on CPU/memory usage.

**Why?**
- Ensures **optimal resource usage** and prevents overloading.
- Automatically scales **based on real-time traffic**.

---

### **6️⃣ Setting Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
**What We Did:**
- Configured **GitHub Actions** to automate builds and deployments.
- Integrated ACR push and Kubernetes deployment steps.

**Why?**
- Automates **deployment processes** to save time and reduce errors.
- Enables **continuous integration and rapid updates**.

---

### **7️⃣ Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana**
**What We Did:**
- Deployed **Prometheus** for collecting Kubernetes and application metrics.
- Configured **Grafana dashboards** for visualization.
- Set up **alerts** for resource spikes.

**Why?**
- Ensures **observability** into the system’s health.
- Helps **proactively identify and fix performance issues**.

---

### **8️⃣ Securing AKS with Azure Key Vault & RBAC**
**What We Did:**
- Stored secrets (e.g., database credentials) in **Azure Key Vault**.
- Implemented **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.

**Why?**
- Prevents **hardcoded secrets**, improving security.
- RBAC ensures **only authorized users** can make changes.

---

## **🔹 Final Outcome & Achievements**
✅ **Fully functional, scalable, and secure web application deployed on AKS**  
✅ **Automated CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployments**  
✅ **Auto-scaling ensures optimal resource utilization**  
✅ **Monitoring helps in proactive issue detection and troubleshooting**  
✅ **Security best practices protect sensitive data**  

---

## **📌 Future Enhancements**
🔹 **Load Testing:** Simulating real-world traffic to observe auto-scaling.  
🔹 **Blue-Green/Canary Deployment:** Implementing zero-downtime updates.  
🔹 **Multi-Region Deployment:** Improving global availability and fault tolerance.  

---

## **🚀 Conclusion**
This project reflects **real-world industry practices** for deploying applications on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. The **combination of CI/CD, autoscaling, monitoring, and security** ensures a production-ready, cloud-native deployment.

**🔹 Technologies Used:** Docker, Kubernetes, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Registry (ACR), GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana, Azure Key Vault, RBAC.

This case study demonstrates how AKS enables businesses to **deploy scalable, automated, and secure cloud applications** efficiently.
